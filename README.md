# Circly

A website created with Flutter and allowing to display a circle of radius 100km around 6 addresses (maximum).

## Release your own version
If you want to release your own version of the project:
- Change the keys of Google Maps (Google Maps Javascript API) and Mapbox in the web\index.html and the main.dart files (The keys presents in the files are limited to https://ionys.ga/circly).
- Get the packages (with "flutter pub get")
- Build (with "flutter build web")
Good to know: Actually, the web features of Flutter are only available in bÃªta or master channels (not in production channel). Be sure to have a good version of Flutter before building the website.
